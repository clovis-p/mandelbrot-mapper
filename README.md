# Mandelbrot Mapper
WIP

Renders the Mandelbrot set with GPU acceleration.

## Controls
* Arrow keys to move around
* Equals key (=) : zoom in
* Minus key (-) : zoom out
* ESC key : quit

## Performance
This is still a work in progress. Computing a frame takes about 20ms at best on my machine, but that doesn't include the time it will take to render a frame, and that's not working yet.
