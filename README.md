# Mandelbrot Mapper
Renders the Mandelbrot set.

## Controls
* Arrow keys to move around
* Equals key (=) : zoom in
* Minus key (-) : zoom out
* ESC key : quit

Rendering is pretty slow as it is only done with the CPU. I'm getting 1 to 15 frames per second on my machine, depending on the resolution and the complexity of what is currently being rendered.
